# DigitalClock
A digital clock made out of logic gates and flip-flops (in logisim).
The clock uses 12-hour time (with AM/PM) and has a RESET button, a +MIN button and a +HOUR button.
This project incorporates the logisim 7-segment-display driver created here: https://github.com/marceloboeira/logisim-7-segment-display-driver.
